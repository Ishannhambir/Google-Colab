**Hand Written Digit Prediction - by Ishan Hambir**

**OBJECTIVE - The primary objective of this project is to create a model capable of accurately identifying handwritten digits. By leveraging machine learning techniques and image processing, we aim to develop an application that can recognize numbers in various contexts.**

**DATA SOURCE - The Digits dataset consistes of 8x8 pixel images of digits. The images attribute of the dataset stores 8x8 arrays of grayscale value for each image .**

"""**EXPLANATION -**
The neural layers work on the recognition of the Handwritten digits. In the background process, the Handwritten Digit Recognizer neural network is going through a series of various layers in the CNN process. When the number has been fed to the model and on clicking the recognize button, the input is sent to the model.
